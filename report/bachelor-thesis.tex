\chapter*{Abstract}

Stencil computations on unstructured grids with a regular Z-dimension are frequently performed in meteorology for atmospheric modeling. While using a GPU to parallelize execution of such stencils promises fast runtimes, supporting the irregular structure in two dimensions complicates their implementation, as neighborship access necessitates indirect memory lookups.

In this thesis, we explore various approaches of storing unstructured grids with one regular dimension and accessing them from the GPU in a stencil computation. We benchmark the performance of three real-world stencils of varying complexity on various unstructured grid implementations, some of which make explicit use of the Z-regularity. In our initial naive approaches, we observe slowdowns of $122\%$ (simple stencil), $52\%$ (medium-complexity stencil), and $5\%$ (complex stencil) compared to executing the same stencils on entirely regular grids. Notably, through a neighborship table compression scheme, we are able to improve those values to $49\%$, $30\%$ and $5\%$ (no improvement) respectively. Other optimizations are explored. We also detail the foundations of the Nvidia CUDA GPU architecture.
